    target: 'The idea behind this project was to help support nursing staff in hospitals, specifically the lead and member nurses.',
    pain: 'As a group project, one of the teammates explained the issues that can occur by poor communication or issues in organizing tasks. Lead nurses have to spend extra time ensuring nurse work loads correspond to abiltiies while serving patients\' needs. They also need to follow up on nurses progress and help or rearrange as necessary. Member nurses spend a lot of time figuring out their schedules with patients and collating information from several different sources. At the same time, they need be aware of their own progress, communicate with other staff, and beaware of any updates.',
    solution: 'By assessing the problems that nursing staff go through, we knew that we wanted to automate patient assignment based on important criteria. After patients were assigned, we wanted to make sure that the Lead nurse could easily track their teams progress. The member nurses wanted a quick overview of their day including the number of tasks, their patients\' severity levels, and a list of their patients. They wanted extra information provided to them for each patient and a way to organize all of their tasks and optimize their schedules. By using a drag and drop system, it easily allowed customization of schedules which were persistent. A notification system allowed for updates to be received along with an assistance buton which directly communicates to their lead nurse.',
